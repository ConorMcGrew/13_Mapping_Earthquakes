# 13_Mapping_Earthquakes

In order to better display the earthquake data, we added plate tectonic lines to the map. This should reveal why so many earthquakes occur in clusters. Additionally, the earthquakes have been regrouped into classes displayed by severity. The major earthquakes now come up as green, midrange ones as yellow, and low severity ones as red.
